# Zeppelin Design System

This Design System enables you to build rich enterprise experiences and custom applications with the patterns and established best practices that are native to Zeppelin.

---

## We want to make it easy for you to create Zeppelin Products!

The use of a style guide helps establish consistency across all Zeppelin Products and helps designers and developers become more efficient. The Zeppelin Design System has the latest styles and elements used across all Zeppelin products in one place so you can easily reference designs and use premade designs.

## Who this site is for?

While we focus on helping designers and developers share reusable designs, this site is for everyone interested in using, or learning about, Zeppelin brand styles. You can find information about our brand colors and typography, how images should look and feel, and what elements (buttons, forms, tabs...) should look like. These designs can be applied to any project that you want to brand as a Zeppelin product.

## Why create a design system?

We want all Zeppelin products to look like they belong to the same brand to create one corporate idenity. To ensure consistencies across products, a design system can provide one easily accessible source of truth that teams can reference. This helps team save time searching for official designs and reduces the accidental use of unoffical designs. Premade designs helps designers and developers become more efficient by reducing time spent duplicating the same styles over and over and more accurate by reducing the likelihood of introducing errors from rewriting designs.

## What can I find here?

**Designers**

The Zeppelin Sketch library: Designers can view designs and download premade sketch files for rapid prototyping and more efficient work flows. Using the Zeppelin Design System sketch files allows designers to focus more time on designing and less time rebuilding individual elements.
