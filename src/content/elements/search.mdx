# Search

Search is the one of the most used features and users expect it to be fast, intelligent, and simple. Search is a method of finding required information from large contents. Basic search is based on a single parameter (usually name) that is used to find an item. Advanced search is a way to find something from a large list of items. Search can also be used as a filter where the user is able to define multiple parameters for a specific criteria.
