# Input

Inputs are the most commonly used form elements and allow the user to submit data. Using labels help users understand what information to enter into a Text Input. For better accessibility labels must be visible when an input gets focus and must be announced to the screen reader on focus. In addition to labels the Zeppelin Design System uses placeholder texts to provide hints or examples of what to enter. These placeholders disappear after the user begins entering data into the Input.
