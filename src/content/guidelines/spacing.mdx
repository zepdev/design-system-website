# Spacing

Spacing is an important part of visual design. The right spacing is important to create relationships and hierarchy between different elements. Less space between elements makes them more related, more space weakens their relationship. Also elements that have more spacing around them tend to be perceived as higher in importance than elements that have less space around them.
