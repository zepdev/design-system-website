# Theme

Themes are used to customize existing elements to fit the specific style of a strategic business unit or product. There is no base color for the Zeppelin-element-library, almost all elements require that a theme class is present. At the moment the Zeppelin Design System offers three main themes. Developers can customize all elements by adding the theme class to any html tag (`<main>`,`<body>`,`<div>`, ...) as long as it wraps all elements you want to use.

We currently offer three main themes;

```js
import "zeppelin-element-library/zel.css"

// Zeppelin Indigo Blue
<div class="theme-indigo" >...</div>

// CAT Yellow
<div class="theme-yelow" >...</div>

// Rental Red
<div class="theme-red" >...</div>
```
