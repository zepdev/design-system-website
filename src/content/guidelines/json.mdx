# guidelines.json

The guidelines.json file is available through each npm package of the zeppelin-element-library (zeppelin-element-library, @zlab-de/zel-react and @zlab-de/zel-vue). It contains all of the content in the guidelines section as variables that can be accessed in javascript. The intent of this file is to help with styling.

For example, in React one solution to sytling is React-JSS. You can pass in guideslines.json as the theme and then you will have access to spacing and colors directly in your css;

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import withStyles from 'react-jss'

const styles = theme => ({
  p: {
    marginBottom: `${theme.spacing.component.xxl.rem}rem`,
    color: theme.theme.indigo.primary,
  },
})

function MyComponent() {
  return <p className={classes.p}>Hello World!</p>
}

export default withStyles(styles)(MyComponent)
```

# Available variables
