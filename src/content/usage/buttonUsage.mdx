## Theme

To implement colors please make sure that you have a theme included. For more information on themes, please visit the Theme Page in the Guidelines Section.

```jsx
<main class="theme-zeppelin" id="app-root">
  ...
  <Button />
  ...
</main>
```

## Accessibility

Button should contain text, if contains icon then icon need aria-label to describe button.

We recommend using button styles on html button elements only (<button />) to ensure that it is accessible to accessibility tools. However, if you are using another element (such as a <div /> or an <a />) make sure to inlcude the following;

1. the element must include the role="button"
2. the element must include enter and spacebar events (as a button would)
3. span and div elements must include proper tabindex properties

```html
<a href="#" role="button" onClick="{fn()}" onKeyDown="{fn()}"
  >Link that looks like a button</a
>

<span role="button" tabIndex="0" onClick="{fn()}" onKeyDown="{fn()}"
  >Custom Button</span
>
```
