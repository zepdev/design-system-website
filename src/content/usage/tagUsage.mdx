## General Guidelines

Tags are mostly used for items on content overview pages that need to be labeled, categorized, or organized.

As part of a filter-bar single or multiple tags can be used as a tool of filtering data, to show only items within a particular category.

It is also possible to use tags on content detail pages to categorized certain items within the whole product portfolio.
