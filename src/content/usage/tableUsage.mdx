## Theme

To implement colors please make sure that you have a theme included. For more information on themes, please visit the Theme Page in the Guidelines Section.

```jsx
<main class="theme-zeppelin" id="app-root">
  ...
  <Table />
  ...
</main>
```

## Accesibility

Please use appropiate html elements for a table as outlined below as well as the following guidelines;

Table elements must include a caption (it can be visually hidden if you don't want it to show visually).

Header Table Cell elements must include the property 'scope="col"'.

The first Table Cell element in the row must include the property 'scope="row"'.

```html
<table>
  <caption className="zep-visually-hidden">
    Table Title
  </caption>
  <thead>
    <tr scrope="col">
      Header Table Cell
    </tr>
    <tr scrope="col">
      Header Table Cell
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <th scrope="row">Table Cell</th>
    <td>Table Cell</td>
  </tbody>
</table>
```
