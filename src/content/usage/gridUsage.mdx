## Implementation

The Zeppelin Design System grid is build with flexbox for modern browsers and has a fallback float grid for legacy browsers.
It uses a basic grid container, rows and columns to layout the content.

<Grid />

```html
<div class="zep-grid">
  <div class="zep-grid__row">
    <div
      class="zep-grid__col zep-grid__col--xxs-1-4 zep-grid__col--xs-3-6 zep-grid__col--m-2-8 zep-grid__col--l-3-12"
    >
      Column 1
    </div>
    <div
      class="zep-grid__col zep-grid__col--xxs-1-4 zep-grid__col--xs-3-6 zep-grid__col--m-2-8 zep-grid__col--l-3-12"
    >
      Column 2
    </div>
    <div
      class="zep-grid__col zep-grid__col--xxs-1-4 zep-grid__col--xs-3-6 zep-grid__col--m-2-8 zep-grid__col--l-3-12"
    >
      Column 3
    </div>
    <div
      class="zep-grid__col zep-grid__col--xxs-1-4 zep-grid__col--xs-3-6 zep-grid__col--m-2-8 zep-grid__col--l-3-12"
    >
      Column 4
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

The above example creates four equal-width columns on extra extra small, extra small, medium and large devices using predefined grid classes.
The width of the columns is always a fixed percentage value, depending on the screensize and the related amount of colums.

Here is the grid data for the used column classes:

<Table
  title="basics grid data"
  header={['identifier', 'screensize', 'columns', 'margin', 'gutter']}
  content={{
    xxs: { identifier: 'xxs', ...grid.xxs },
    xs: { identifier: 'xs', ...grid.xs },
    m: { identifier: 'm', ...grid.m },
    l: { identifier: 'l', ...grid.l },
  }}
/>

The `.zep-grid` class is for the main grid container with a 100% width. It has the horizontal margins that are defined in the grid data table for each screensize breakpoint.
A main grid has to contain `.zep-grid__row` elements for each row.
Each row can hold the needed amount of `.zep-grid__col` column elements.
Each column has horizontal padding (called a gutter) for controlling the space between them. This padding is then counteracted on the rows with negative margins.
The maximum amount of columns per row is depending on the screensize.
Therefore it is necessary to define the column sizes based on this max. amount.

Define a colum width of 25% from total grid width:

- screensize < 576px = xxs = max. amount of columns: 4 = 25% of 4: 1 => zep-grid\*\*col--xxs-1-4
- screensize ≥ 576px = xs = max. amount of columns: 6 = 25% of 6: 1.5 => impossible to split 6 for 25%
- screensize ≥ 768px = s = max. amount of columns: 6 = 25% of 6: 1.5 => does not fit into grid
- screensize ≥ 992px = m = max. amount of columns: 8 = 25% of 8: 2 => zep-grid\*\*col--m-2-8
- screensize ≥ 1200px = l = max. amount of columns: 12 = 25% of 12: 3 => zep-grid\*\*col--l-3-12
- screensize ≥ 1680px = xl = max. amount of columns: 12 = 25% of 12: 3 => zep-grid\*\*col--xl-3-12

Columns that exceed the provided space per row are visually wrapped into the next row, but technically stay in the same row element.
