### Theme

To implement colors please make sure that you have a theme included. For more information on themes, please visit the Theme Page in the Guidelines Section.

```jsx
<main class="theme-zeppelin" id="app-root">
  ...
  <Checkbox />
  ...
</main>
```

### Accessibility

If you do not include a label for your checkbox element, you must ensure it is still available for Accessibility tools by adding an aria-label to the input element.

```jsx
<input aria-label="Checkbox Zeppelin" {...props} />
```
