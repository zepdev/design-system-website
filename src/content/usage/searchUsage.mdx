## Theme

To implement colors please make sure that you have a theme included. For more information on themes, please visit the Theme Page in the Guidelines Section.

```jsx
<main class="theme-zeppelin" id="app-root">
  ...
  <Search />
  ...
</main>
```

## Accessibility

All input elements require the inclusion of a cooresponding label element. It can be visually hidden from designs with 'zep-visually-hidden'.

Include the landmark 'role="search"' around the input element if it searches the website or webpage.

```html
<form role="search">
  <label for="search">
    <span class="zep-visually-hidden">Search</span>
  </label>
  <input type="text" id="search" />
</form>
```
